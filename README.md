TUI-driven Encryption Tool for Domestic Use-Case

ATTENTION:
REPO MIGRATED TO [CODEBERG](https://codeberg.org/breddiesucks/pollyanna). RAISON D'ETRE IS PRETTY OBVIOUS WHEN YOU SEE A LINUX DAILY DRIVER.

Pollyanna is a simple implementation of encryption/decryption aimed at layman use, with an experimental approach for encryption key assignment.

Program Status:

=> Fully Functional Encrypter/Decrypter mechanism

=> Basic makefile setup

What next?

=> CLI interface

=> More robust file management system



Thematic Influences: The plot progression of Mother (cult-classic Japanese RPG) where you collect the music pieces termed as 'melodies' from various parts across their journey and piece it up, only to realize that the key is with them all along the way, in the merry melody across the game and unfettered optimism. Personal correlations regarding few uncommon technical terms can come in handy, atleast in a layman's workflow. I have an habit of correlating few technical factors with pop culture references, which can end up making the code more unreadable than Common Lisp on the long run, but hey, I gave my program a life, and I can draw a caricature of it in my head. This approach worked for me, and this is my attempt to recreate it, this time, we know we have the key.
