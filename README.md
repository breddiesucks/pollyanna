# pollyanna
TUI-driven Encryption Tool for Domestic Use-Case

Pollyanna is a simple implementation of encryption/decryption aimed at layman use, with an experimental approach for encryption key assignment.



Design Influences: Mother's (Japanese RPG game) plot where you collect the pieces of melodies from various parts and pieces it up, the key being themselves, and how the cipher-melody was with them all along the way.

The idea that we can simplify few domestic constraints with the help of scaling complex processes down but it can do a neat job when you are into recreational cipher construction and management of passcodes (DON'T STORE THE PASSCODES ONLINE, STORE IT AS A BIN OR TXT IN LOCAL MACHINE, NOT THE REMOTE ONES)
