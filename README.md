TUI-driven Encryption Tool for Domestic Use-Case

Pollyanna is a simple encryption tool whose intended use-case is to encode/decode and take a bohemian approach to encryption keys.

1. What prompted this project?
------------------------------
Encryption remained integral to digital information management, as security and a classified conduct to process the encrypted cipher. It is a more sophesticated interpretation of the encoding/decoding mechanisms learnt in beginner Digital Systems.

The idea that one can maintain encrypted info in their own accord using a simple encryption system, sounds potent and interesting, opening up a new perspective regarding information management, or moreso, a computer's viability as an efficient tool.

Now, cutting to the chase, when I use encrypted info/API tokens in as a layman, I observed a lack of a solid and streamlined method in storing and managing the concerned passcodes. With the heavy reliance of further complicated passcodes and API tokens, I sense a downward spiral regarding this matter. And hence it serves as the primer to this simple but humble endeavour.


2. What is the "bohemian" approach I was referring to?
------------------------------------------------------
Encryption is done based on a particular criterion, which is summarized and concentrated into a string, called as "Encryption Keys". Despite the efficacy, safety and management of encryption keys in an automated workflow, on a personal layman use, encryption keys seem to add yet another level of cipher management. The elephant in the room was that management of encryption keys leads to a peeling onions, only adding more practical complications.

Then struct to me the characteristic plot element in the game "Mother". The game's major plot progression in Mother (or EarthBound Beginnings outside Japan) uses music, or moreso, melodies as ciphers to crack a mythical cipher, only to realize the cipher is with you all along. This sparked in me an eccentric ambition to management of encrypted media and the shift in structure and conduct of encryption keys.
