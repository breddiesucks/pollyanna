# pollyanna
TUI-driven Encryption Tool for Domestic Use-Case

Pollyanna is a simple implementation of encryption/decryption aimed at layman use, with an experimental approach for encryption key assignment.

Program Status:
1. Encrypter is functional, decrypter works in specific parameters (incomplete)
2. key to array
3. encryption and decryption based on array key

Thematic Influences: Mother's (Japanese RPG game) plot where you collect the pieces of melodies from various parts and pieces it up, the key being themselves, and how the cipher-melody was with them all along the way. Personal correlations regarding few uncommon technical terms can come in handy, atleast in a layman's workflow. I have an habit of correlation with pop culture references, which can end up detrimental on the long run, but hey, I gave my program a life, and I can draw a caricature of it in my head. This approach worked for me, and this is my attempt to recreate it for strings.
